 Data exploration about red and white wine by Dimitra and Jakob

Wine factors and explanation

Acidity:

Fixed Acidity: Contributes to the tartness or crispness of the wine. Wines with the right balance of acidity often taste fresher.
Flavor Components:

Volatile Acidity: Provides fruity and floral aromas but excessive amounts can lead to unpleasant vinegar-like flavors.
Citric Acid: Adds a citrusy flavor to the wine.
Sweetness:

Residual Sugar: The amount of sugar left in the wine after fermentation. Determines the sweetness level.
Saltiness:

Chlorides: In small amounts, contribute to the saltiness of the wine.
Sulfur Compounds:

Free Sulfur Dioxide and Total Sulfur Dioxide: Play a role in preventing oxidation and preserving the wine. Too much can result in off-putting aromas.
Density:

Affects the mouthfeel of the wine. Higher density may result in a fuller-bodied wine.
pH:

Influences the perceived acidity. Wines with the right pH balance can taste more harmonious.
Sulfites:

Sulphates: Act as preservatives. Too much can affect the taste negatively.
Alcohol Content:

Alcohol: Affects the body, warmth, and mouthfeel of the wine. Higher alcohol content may result in a bolder wine.
Sensory Attributes:

Quality: Subjective and often assessed based on overall sensory experience.
Wine Type: The type of wine (red or white) contributes to different flavor profiles.
Other Components:

Tannins (in red wines): Contribute to structure and astringency.
Aromas and Bouquet: Derived from the grape variety, winemaking process, and aging.
Balance and Harmony:

A well-balanced wine has a harmonious integration of these factors without one overpowering the others.

According to our correlation values for "quality":

quality (Target Variable): The correlation of "quality" with itself is always 1. This is expected since it represents the correlation of the variable with itself.

alcohol (Positive Correlation): The highest positive correlation is observed with "alcohol" (0.444319). This positive correlation suggests that higher alcohol content is associated with higher wine quality. In other words, wines with higher alcohol content tend to have higher quality ratings.

citric acid (Positive Correlation): A positive correlation of 0.085532 suggests a weak positive relationship. Higher citric acid content is weakly associated with higher wine quality.

free sulfur dioxide (Positive Correlation): A positive correlation of 0.055463 indicates a weak positive relationship. Higher levels of free sulfur dioxide are weakly associated with higher wine quality.

sulphates (Positive Correlation): A positive correlation of 0.038485 suggests a weak positive relationship. Higher levels of sulphates are weakly associated with higher wine quality.

pH (Positive Correlation): A positive correlation of 0.019506 suggests a very weak positive relationship. There is a minimal positive association between pH and wine quality.

residual sugar (Negative Correlation): A negative correlation of -0.036980 indicates a weak negative relationship. Higher residual sugar content is weakly associated with lower wine quality.

total sulfur dioxide (Negative Correlation): A negative correlation of -0.041385 indicates a weak negative relationship. Higher total sulfur dioxide levels are weakly associated with lower wine quality.

fixed acidity (Negative Correlation): A negative correlation of -0.076743 indicates a weak negative relationship. Higher fixed acidity is weakly associated with lower wine quality.

chlorides (Negative Correlation): A negative correlation of -0.200666 suggests a moderate negative relationship. Higher chloride levels are moderately associated with lower wine quality.

volatile acidity (Negative Correlation): A negative correlation of -0.265699 suggests a moderate negative relationship. Higher volatile acidity is moderately associated with lower wine quality.

density (Negative Correlation): A negative correlation of -0.305858 suggests a moderate negative relationship. Higher density is moderately associated with lower wine quality.

In summary, positive correlations indicate that as the feature increases, wine quality tends to increase, while negative correlations indicate that as the feature increases, wine quality tends to decrease. The strength of the correlation is interpreted as weak, moderate, or strong based on the absolute value of the correlation coefficient.
