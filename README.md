 Data exploration about red and white wine

Wine factors and explanation

Acidity:

Fixed Acidity: Contributes to the tartness or crispness of the wine. Wines with the right balance of acidity often taste fresher.
Flavor Components:

Volatile Acidity: Provides fruity and floral aromas but excessive amounts can lead to unpleasant vinegar-like flavors.
Citric Acid: Adds a citrusy flavor to the wine.
Sweetness:

Residual Sugar: The amount of sugar left in the wine after fermentation. Determines the sweetness level.
Saltiness:

Chlorides: In small amounts, contribute to the saltiness of the wine.
Sulfur Compounds:

Free Sulfur Dioxide and Total Sulfur Dioxide: Play a role in preventing oxidation and preserving the wine. Too much can result in off-putting aromas.
Density:

Affects the mouthfeel of the wine. Higher density may result in a fuller-bodied wine.
pH:

Influences the perceived acidity. Wines with the right pH balance can taste more harmonious.
Sulfites:

Sulphates: Act as preservatives. Too much can affect the taste negatively.
Alcohol Content:

Alcohol: Affects the body, warmth, and mouthfeel of the wine. Higher alcohol content may result in a bolder wine.
Sensory Attributes:

Quality: Subjective and often assessed based on overall sensory experience.
Wine Type: The type of wine (red or white) contributes to different flavor profiles.
Other Components:

Tannins (in red wines): Contribute to structure and astringency.
Aromas and Bouquet: Derived from the grape variety, winemaking process, and aging.
Balance and Harmony:

A well-balanced wine has a harmonious integration of these factors without one overpowering the others.
